# Kevin-s-Website
Hi!  This is my personal portfolio/project website I have created and am still working on.  
I'm using this as a tool to work on my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills and exploring what it is like to do frontend web development.

So far, I am enjoying it and am playing with all the tools I have at my disposal.

Thanks for checking it out!
